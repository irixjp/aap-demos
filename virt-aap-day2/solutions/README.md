# Day 2 Operations with OpenShift Virtualization and Ansible Automation Platform- Solution Collection

Welcome to the solution collection for the **Day 2 Operations with OpenShift
Virtualization and Ansible Automation Platform** lab. This repository contains
all the necessary resources, playbooks, and configurations to implement and
automate the tasks demonstrated in the lab using the Ansible Automation Platform
(AAP).

## About the Lab

This lab is designed to equip you with the tools and knowledge to efficiently
manage Virtual Machines (VMs) hosted on OpenShift with AAP. By leveraging
Ansible's automation capabilities, you'll perform critical operational tasks to
ensure your workloads are secure, resilient, and properly maintained.

## What's Included in This Collection

This solution collection is tailored to the lab and includes:

- **Lifecycle Management of VMs**:
   Tasks to stop, start, and restart VMs using the `redhat.openshift_virtualization` Ansible Collection.
  
- **Security Patch Management**:
  Solutions to apply security updates on VMs using the `dnf` Ansible module.

- **Dynamic Inventory Configuration**:
  Step-by-step configurations to dynamically manage OpenShift-hosted VMs in AAP.

- **Backup and Restore of VMs**:
  Playbooks to create backups of VMs and restore them to ensure data integrity and system resilience.

## Purpose

This collection serves as a reference and practical solution to the hands-on
lab exercises. It enables you to revisit, adapt, and automate similar Day 2
operations in your real-world OpenShift Virtualization environments.
